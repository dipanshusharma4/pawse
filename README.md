# Pawse: Your AI Pet Friend for Mental Wellness

## Problem

Many young people feel stressed, anxious, or lonely but hesitate to talk about it. Fear of being judged or labeled “weak” (stigma) keeps them from sharing their feelings and seeking help.

## Our Solution

**Pawse** is an AI-powered confidential app featuring an anime-style pet companion. Your pet friend chats with you in a warm, empathetic way and supports your mental wellness journey.

- **Confidential & stigma-free:** Anonymous, no judgment.
- **Emotional bond:** A pet companion makes support feel natural, safe, and fun.
- **Youth-focused design:** Gamified, anime-inspired, and relatable.
- **Bridging the gap:** Smooth handoff to real counselors when needed.

### Features

- **Chat with your AI pet:** Friendly, supportive conversations.
- **Self-care suggestions:** Breathing exercises, journaling, gratitude tasks, and more.
- **Mood tracking:** Monitor your feelings and progress—no pressure, no labels.
- **Crisis support:** If you’re struggling, the app can gently connect you to professional counselors—still confidential.
